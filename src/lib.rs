//! 
//! [`workflow_core`] is a part of the [`workflow-rs`](https://crates.io/workflow-rs) 
//! framework, subset of which is designed to function uniformally across multiple 
//! environments including native Rust, WASM-browser and Solana OS targets.
//!
//! This is a general-purpose crate that provides platform-uniform (native and WASM) abstractions for:
//! - async channels
//! - task spawn and sleep functions
//! - random identifiers
//! - async-friendly and threadsafe event triggers 
//! - time (Instant and Duration) structs
//! - dynamic async_trait attribute macros
//!
